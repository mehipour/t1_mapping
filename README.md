# T1 Mapping

* Code is written in MATLAB.
* This takes multiple dicom images using a varaible-flip-angle method obtained with the FLASH sequence.
* The method is used currently by our group and a collaborator for preclinical studies, but is extendable to clinical studies. 
* you can read more about the method here:
